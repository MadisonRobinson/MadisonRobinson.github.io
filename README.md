## Welcome to My Sample Website!


For the basics section of our class, I will be demonstrating a very basic knowledge of Markdown on this page. 


First of all, I will start by demonstrating a header.



### This is My New Header


Another use of markdown is the list. This can be useful for many different applications

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
4. item 4
5. item 5

Next, I will demonstrate a table. These can be filled with numbers, letters, or whatever information pertains to the table. I have chosen nonsensical letters simply to show the structure and look of a table.

| Titel 1       | Title 2       |Title 3|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| a             | b             | c     |
| d             | e             | f     |
| g             | g             | h     |


The final task is to demonstrate that I understand how to make a link. My link can be found [here](www.google.com) and it should simply link you to google. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
Thanks!
